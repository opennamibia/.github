### Hi there 👋🏾, Welcome to Open Source Nambia. 

To help reduce reinventing the wheel, we created Open Namibia as an archive to collect all repositories and open source contributions related to Namibia and Beyond. Our next goal is to develop a website to host all current developments, not only tech but social and so on. We believe this can encourage and motivate larger groups of individuals with common goals work together and make Namibia a digital Nation.
